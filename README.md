# google-script-games
Some games I made while having some fun with Google Script.

If you're from my portfolio, GS is kinda the same as JS, so I just marked it as that.

Games:
Guess the Number
Tic Tac Toe
Mystery Game

In a Google Doc, click `Tools` > `<> Script Editor`, then copy and paste the script there. Save it, and reload the doc. At the top, there should be a menu called "`Play a Game`," which you can find all of the games under it.
